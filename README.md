# projectManagementSystem

I am still cooking up this project, however.
This project would be good for a small structural engineering firm, that does engineering
needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. This program can be used
to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

The program will allow the firm to **capture** and **keep track** of the following information for 
each project:
+ project number
+ project name
+ what type of building is being designed
+ physical address of the project
+ ERF number
+ the total fee being charged for the project
+ total amount paid to date 
+ deadline for the project
+ credentials of the architect of the project
+ credentials of the contractor of the project 
+ credentials of the customer

All the information will be stored in a text file. The program will allow for the firm to update and make
changes to any part of the information on a project. The program will also allow the firm to check 
and keep track of projects that still need to be completed as well as projects that are past due date.
Projects will also be found by entering the project name of project number.

To get started on the project simply push to your machine and get going. I am currenlty still working 
on this project so defintely open for collabs and some helpful hands. lets have fun!👍:
